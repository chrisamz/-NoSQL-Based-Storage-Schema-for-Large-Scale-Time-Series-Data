# NoSQL-Based Storage Schema for Large-Scale Time Series Data

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design an efficient storage schema for large-scale time-series data using NoSQL databases. This involves creating a schema tailored specifically for time-series data, implementing the schema, evaluating its performance, and providing a query interface for data retrieval and analysis.

## Features
1. **Schema Design for Time-Series Data**
   - Tailored schema optimized for storing and querying time-series data.
   - Considerations for data partitioning, indexing, and compression.

2. **Implementation and Performance Evaluation**
   - Implementation of the designed schema using NoSQL databases like Cassandra and InfluxDB.
   - Performance evaluation metrics include read/write throughput, latency, and storage efficiency.

3. **Query Interface for Data Retrieval and Analysis**
   - Development of a user-friendly query interface.
   - Support for common time-series data queries and analysis operations.
   - Integration with visualization tools for data analysis.

## Technologies
- **NoSQL Databases**: Cassandra and InfluxDB
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Ingestion**: Apache Kafka

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Cassandra and/or InfluxDB installed and configured
- Apache Kafka installed and configured

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nosql-time-series-storage.git
   cd nosql-time-series-storage
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure NoSQL Databases**
   - Follow the official documentation to set up Cassandra and/or InfluxDB.
   - Ensure the databases are running and accessible.

5. **Configure Apache Kafka**
   - Follow the official documentation to set up Apache Kafka.
   - Ensure Kafka is running and accessible.

6. **Run Data Ingestion Script**
   ```bash
   python data_ingestion/kafka_producer.py
   ```

7. **Run Query Interface**
   ```bash
   python query_interface/query_interface.py
   ```

## Usage

### Data Ingestion
- The `kafka_producer.py` script uses Apache Kafka to ingest time-series data into the configured NoSQL database.
- Configure the data source and Kafka topics in the `config.yaml` file before running.

### Query Interface
- The `query_interface.py` script provides a command-line interface for querying the time-series data.
- Use the provided commands to perform data retrieval and analysis operations.

### Performance Evaluation
- Scripts for performance evaluation are included in the `performance_evaluation` directory.
- Run these scripts to evaluate the performance of the storage schema under different conditions.
